## INTRO ##

From the darkest night to the faintest glint,
here now the menace has born again,
taking form from time and space,
to plunder the village and lay its waste.

For you to earn ale and bed,
its up to you, Bard, to raise your head,
look above the fiery land,
raise your sword, and play your hand!

/////

## WIN ##

Bard, you are a hero! The people of this village thank you for your valiant efforts.

Enjoy your ale and bed!
